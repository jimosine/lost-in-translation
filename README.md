# Lost in Translation

Lost in Translation is a web application where users can translate English text to American sign language. 

After logging in with a username, the user is greeted on their profile page which shows their 10 most recent translations and action buttons to logout or clear their history. 

On the translations page, the user can type words or short sentences, and after continuing is responded with images which correspond to the sign language translation of the text.
